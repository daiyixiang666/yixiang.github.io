      - Built pretraining pipelines for video and image generation models using autoregressive architectures.
      - Developed a training-free multiscale VQVAE method, eliminating instability in original training methods.
      - Processed large-scale multimodal data for training and evaluated performance on generative tasks.

      - Investigated the impact of frequency components in classifier-free guidance during diffusion model generation.
      - Found that low-frequency guidance dominates in early stages, enhancing semantic structure and object presence; high-frequency guidance refines class- or text-based details in later stages.
      - Proposed two frequency-based methods to improve FID:
        1. Extended unconditional branch timesteps to enhance low-frequency structure modeling, reducing FID from 28.03 to 26.36.
        2. Replaced unconditional attention with conditional attention in specific layers to strengthen high-frequency details.
