      text: |-
        I'm an undergraduate researcher at the University of Michigan, focusing on generative AIâ€”especially diffusion and autoregressive models. 

        My work explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of image and video generation. From understanding Gaussian structures in diffusion models to accelerating training with efficient architectures, I aim to make generative models more interpretable, scalable, and impactful.

        I'm always open to collaboration or cool ideasâ€”feel free to reach out!
